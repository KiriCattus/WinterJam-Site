<h4>NOTICE!!! Work on world generation first!</h4>
<span>
	For mods that intend on including world generation, we STRONGLY recommend you work on that first
	(or as soon as possible) so that it can be tested and generated when we set up the server and
	pack. The remainder of content can be added later on if required.
